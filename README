1. Introduction
	Simple game in which a point is moving on a platform.
	Fall out and the game is over.

	Control buttons:
	  0 = Quit game
	  1 = One step forward
	  2 = One step backward
	  3 = Turn clockwise i.e. + 90 degrees
	  4 = Turn counterclockwise i.e. - 90 degrees
	  
	Play by typing in numbers into the standard in.

	The first two numbers specifies the platform's size.
	The following two numbers specifies the starting position of the point.

2. How to run from command line:
	cd PATH/platformGame
	make all

3. How to start the tests:
	cd PATH/platformGame
    make test

	To run the tests the below jars needs to be in the jar folder
	    hamcrest-core-1.3.jar  
	    junit-4.12.jar

4. Example:
	Here we run the game in logging mode.
	cd PATH/platformGame
	make clean
	make compile
	make run-log 
	java src.platformGame.Main log

		[3, 1]

	We entered 0 and the game quits, printing the current position.
	
	Fall outside of the platform and [-1, -1] will be printed.
